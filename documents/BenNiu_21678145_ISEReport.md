# Version control

I create an empty repo and upload initial files to master branch.  
I will create 3 branches to develop different modules:  

- Branch "common" is used to develop common modules and methods and test code.  
- Branch "life_path" is used to develop life path number calculator and test code.  
- Branch "generation" is used to develop generation finder and test code.

After developed complete, merge back patches to master branch.
